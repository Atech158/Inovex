# Mobile Preview with Expo

bolt.diy ships with starter templates for building mobile apps using **React Native** and **Expo**. These templates can be selected from the starter template picker. After cloning a template, navigate to the `mobile` directory and start the Expo development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

The Expo CLI displays a QR code in the terminal and in the browser-based dev tools. Scan this code using the **Expo Go** app on your iOS or Android device to preview the application instantly.

You can also run `pnpm android` or `pnpm ios` to launch an emulator if you have one configured.
